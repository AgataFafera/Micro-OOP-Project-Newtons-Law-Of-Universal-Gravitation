Title: Newton's law of universal gravitation

Description: An app that gets as input the masses of two objects and the distance beetwen the centres 
of their masses. Then it calculates the force beetwen the masses and returns the pdf file with all variables 
and the result. 

Objects: 
            Equation:
            mass of object 1
            mass of object 2 
            constant of gravitation
            distance 
            def calculate(mass of object 1, mass of object 2, constant of gravitation, distance)
            return force
